# Penguin_Assignment_Q4
Directory structure and code used to complete Q4 of the penguin assignment

Note to assessor: main file to be assessed is R markdown file in combination with the 'support' files (functions, libraries, plotting, figures). I have also included the original .R file I used to formulate code
in the directory marked 'draft' if this is helpful, but can be ignored if not.
